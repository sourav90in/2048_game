The object of the game is to join the tiles together (using the arrow keys) to create larger and larger tiles. When an arrow key is pressed, the “gravity” changes in that direction. When two pieces fall onto each other, if they have the same value they are joined together and get the sum of the tiles as the new value. Each time a move is made, either a 2 or a 4 tile is randomly added to the board. The game is over when the player gets one tile with the value 2048, or when the board is full and no moves can be made.

A Version of the game can be found:http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/

This project implements the 2048 game without GUI display.
